# Bad Language

Bad language is a simple lipsy language to help teach myself to write a compiler. I have not used any formal methods here I have just made it up as I have gone along. By compiling to JS there isn't really much 'compiling' to do as JS is quite rich and has the constructs I need to just translate.

Have a look at the .m files (m is a random extension name, you can choose anything) and you get an idea of what this language can do. Not much at the moment, but just enough for a Fibonacci Sequence.
